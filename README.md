# A Not-so-comprehensive-nor-complex VHS filter 

---

An application to add a VHS filter over images (using OpenCV)

I mostly created this because I needed a way to make images look like they're VHS tape stills.

It's very much work in progress and is not perfect, but I'm hoping to make it "perfect" soon.



## Windows binaries

I will compile Windows binaries soon.


## Building

Make sure you have OpenCV and cmake installed

``cmake .``
